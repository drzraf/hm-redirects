== Changelog ==

= 0.4.2 =
* Fix fatal error during WP CLI script execution caused by incorrect class name when calling WP_CLI::add_command
* Fix php linting errors

= 0.4.1 =
* Use `get_page_by_path()` instead of a `WP_Query` in `get_redirect_post()`. The `get_page_by_path()` function uses
  an object cache bucket for post paths to id matches, therefore potentially speeding up the lookup.

* Remove usage of `filter_var()` to support domains with non-ASCII characters.

= 0.3 =
* Add WP-CLI commands.

= 0.2 =
* Internationalisation improvements.

= 0.1 =
* Initial release. Handles redirects path and query argument redirects on the same domain.
